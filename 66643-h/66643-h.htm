<h2 class="main">PREFACE.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">This is a Byliny Book. What does “Byliny” mean? It is a Russian word, and it means
stories about <i>What-has-Been</i>, what happened in Russia in the old days long ago. We all read about the Greek heroes
Jason and Perseus and Theseus and Heracles. The Russians had splendid heroes too,
who met with wonderful adventures. Russia and France and Italy and England are fighting
side by side a great fight for freedom, and these old heroes of Russia fought for
freedom too, against great barbarian armies of Huns and Tartars. The Russians are
our brave friends, our “Allies,” as we call them now, and it is good to get to know
about their heroes of olden times.
</p>
<p>We all know and honour our French Allies, and most of us try to speak French. We are
proud to read in history how our William the Conqueror came over from France and brought
with him many good laws and customs, and, best of all, beautiful French words that
have now become English—why, the very word <i>beauty</i> came to us from France. But Russia is much further away than France, and very few
of us learn to speak Russian, or even to read it.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb.viii">[<a href="#pb.viii">viii</a>]</span></p>
<p>Far the best way to get to know people is to learn their language, but it is not quite
so easy to learn to read Russian as it is to read French, because the Russians use
different letters. You will see Russian letters in the pictures<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e176src" href="#xd31e176">1</a>; they are beautiful, delightful things and some of them are like English, so it is
exciting to try and make them out, but some of them are like Greek, for the Russians
always liked the Greeks better than the Romans.
</p>
<p>The Russian names of the heroes look a little strange at first, but they are not really
hard to pronounce. There are a great many Russian heroes, but this book only tells
about four of them, Volgá and Mikúla and Svyatogór and Ilyá. The Volgá is quite short
and easy, and so is Mikúla, which is pronounced as if it was written Mikóolla. Svyatogór
looks rather hard, but you only have to remember to say it like this—Svyătăgórr, and
you must roll the r’s as if you were a Scotsman. The Russians put the accent on the
end of their words much oftener than the English. We say Ī́-văn and they say <i>Eeváhn</i>. And so it is with the last hero, Ilyá; he is pronounced <i>Eelyā́h</i>. Besides the heroes, there is Vladímir the king, and he is called Vladéemir. The
only really hard word to say right is <i>Byliny</i> itself, and that you can call Bwĭléeny, but our English lips do not make quite the
Russian sound.
</p>
<p>These heroes Volgá and Ilyá and the rest lived very <span class="pageNum" id="pb.ix">[<a href="#pb.ix">ix</a>]</span>long ago, and their great city was not Petrograd but Kiev (Kieff). Petrograd means
“Peter’s fortified town,” and we all know how till the war it used to be called Peters-burg.
But if you look on the map you will find no Petrograd, only Kiev on the river Dnieper,
which winds down to the Black Sea. The old Russian heroes used to sail down the river
on through the Black Sea down to Constantinople, and there of course they met the
Greeks, and the Greeks taught them to be Christians. That was in the days of good
King Vladímir, and he was reigning before our William the Conqueror, hundreds of years
before Peter the Great came to Holland and England and learnt to build boats, and
made the great city of Petrograd.
</p>
<p>But though the heroes lived so long ago, they are never forgotten. The Russian children
in the village schools learn about Volgá and Ilyá as soon as they can read, and old
minstrels in far away villages beyond lake Onéga and even in Siberia sing the Byliny,
the songs of <i>What-has-Been</i> to the peasants as they sit round the fire at night. I have seen a picture of one
of these singers, an old peasant over seventy, with a long white beard and shaggy
hair and bright deep-set eyes. He could not write or read, and his voice was rather
cracked, but when he sang the old songs he was all on fire, and he sang them so splendidly
that the villagers crowded round to hear. The old men say that the young ones will
not learn to sing the songs because they are <i>gramotnye</i>, “grammar-people,” who read books and learn to write—what a pity.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb.x">[<a href="#pb.x">x</a>]</span></p>
<p>A learned Russian called Hilferding went to North Russia to live among the peasants
and listen to these stories. The peasants are very poor, and are shy with strangers,
but they learned to love and trust Hilferding, and sang their songs to him. It is
nice to know that he was able to help the peasants, and get them a little more money
and food. Other learned men had been before Hilferding, but nearly all the stories
in this book were collected by him, so we like to remember his name.
</p>
<p>It is the peasants who sing the Byliny, not the nobles, and two of the greatest Russian
heroes, Ilyá and Mikúla, are peasants’ sons. Mikúla is a ploughman. It sounds strange
to us that a ploughman should be a hero; but the Russians did not feel like that.
They love their land with all their hearts. Some of it has very black fertile soil,
but some of it is very hard and full of stones, and sometimes of forests to be cleared,
and the man who does all this is a hero. The Russians sing a hymn to the honour of
Mikúla; it ends “Glory to thee, good Mikúla, the peasant who worked.” In one of the
pictures you see Volgá, the prince, come to beg Mikúla to leave his plough and join
his warriors. Mikúla was sad, but a man must leave even his work to defend his country.
Mikúla is my favourite of all the heroes.
</p>
<p>The peasant heroes, Mikúla and great Ilyá, are very proud and independent, and sometimes
not very respectful to the King; they seem to think they are as good as he is, and
so they were. It is their country <span class="pageNum" id="pb.xi">[<a href="#pb.xi">xi</a>]</span>they love, and their beautiful city of Kiev and its Church, and in those old days
they had not learned that the King stands for the country. Ilyá is always wanting
to get to Kiev; you see him on the cover of this book, riding up to the Holy City.
It is like Jerusalem to him, and he was buried there. But though he dreams of the
City, he loves the place where he was born, near Múrom. Múrom is a real place still,
with forests round it and a river full of fish. The peasants in the old days owned
the land in common, so each village was like a little kingdom. Ilyá hates the dog,
King <span class="corr" id="xd31e207" title="Source: Kalin">Kálin</span>, because he slays the villagers.
</p>
<p>Svyatogór’s name means Holy Mountain. He is very strong and huge, like a mountain,
but he is clumsy and rather boastful. He boasted he could lift anything, but he soon
found he couldn’t. At the end he stops boasting, and is good to young Ilyá, and gives
him all his strength, so that makes up.
</p>
<p>The hero who really can do everything is Volgá. He was a prince, not a peasant, and
he was a mighty hunter, like Nimrod in the Bible; and he was a wizard, too, and could
turn himself into a grey wolf. Some people said his father was a wolf, some said he
was a serpent. The story says “damp earth was his cradle,” and that sounds uncomfortable,
but the Russians always call the earth “damp earth.” They mean that the rain has rained
on it, and that it is not hard and dry, but full of sap like the trees. Volgá learnt
all his wisdom from the beasts and birds. S. Francis used to preach to the birds,
but Volgá let <span class="pageNum" id="pb.xii">[<a href="#pb.xii">xii</a>]</span>the beasts and birds preach to him, and that is better, for the <a class="biblink xd31e48" title="Reference to the Bible: Job 12:7" href="https://classic.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jb%2012:7&amp;version=NRSV">Bible</a> says:
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Ask now the beasts and they shall teach thee; </p>
<p class="line">And the fowls of the air and they shall tell thee. </p>
</div>
<p class="first">The first story is about Volgá, and in the first picture you see him listening to
a wise old Bear.

<p class="xd31e229">This book is for children, and is no place for bibliography, but we should like to
own our debt to three books. Chudinov’s <i>Byliny</i> in the “Russian School Library” was our first introduction (in Russian) to the hero-tales;
but for Rambaud’s <i lang="fr">La Russie Épique</i> it would have been difficult to put the stories together; and, last, to the kindness
of Mr. E.&nbsp;T. Minns we are indebted for the loan of Hilferding’s invaluable <i>Sbornik</i>, now out of print, and not easily obtainable during the War.

<h2 class="super xd31e428">Hero Tales of Russia.</h2>
<h2 class="label">I.</h2>
<h2 class="main">THE STORY OF VOLGÁ.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The red sun was going down behind the high hills, behind the blue sea. The countless
stars showed themselves in the clear sky, and the bright moon was shining in the heavens
when Volgá the Hero was born in Holy Russia. Damp Mother Earth was his cradle. The
earth rocked, and there was a great storm upon the blue sea, and the fish went down
into the deep sea, the birds flew up into the sky, the great aurochs and the deer
fled over the hills, the hares and rabbits ran into the thick forest, and the wolves
and bears fled away among the fir trees, sables and martens escaped to the islands,
because they knew that a hero was born in Russia.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>When Volgá was an hour and a half old he spoke with a voice like thunder, and said:
</p>
<p>“Come then, O Lady, my mother, young Márfa, put no baby-clothes upon me, nor a sash
of silk, but give me strong steel armour, and on my head put a helmet of gold. In
my right hand a club, a club made heavy with lead of the weight of a hundred pounds.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb2">[<a href="#pb2">2</a>]</span></p>
<p>When Volgá was seven years old his mother had him taught to read, and she made him
write with a pen. And from all the birds and beasts he learnt their skill and wisdom
and the different tongues of all, and he understood the speech of all the beasts of
the field and forest, and of all the birds and fishes.
</p>
<p>When he was ten years old he learned much magic. First he learned to turn himself
into a bright falcon, and next he learned to turn himself into a grey wolf, and the
third thing he learned was to turn himself into a brown aurochs, a brown aurochs with
golden hoofs.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>When Volgá was seventeen he called his friends and companions together and formed
a bodyguard of thirty youths save one, and Volgá himself was the thirtieth. He was
their Chief, and took them with him on his journeys. He provided for them all and
gave them abundance of food and drink, and of sugar sweetmeats many kinds. And warm
clothes, too, he gave them, fur coats made of the skins of marten and sable and of
panther. When his comrades slept Volgá slept not. Sometimes he turned himself into
a grey wolf and ran and leaped in the dark forest and killed moose-deer and bears
and wolves. Martens and panthers were his favourite prey, and he spared neither hares
nor foxes. And at other times he turned himself into a bright falcon, flew far away
over the blue sea and killed geese and white swans, and the little grey ducks he spared
not.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb3">[<a href="#pb3">3</a>]</span></p>
<p>One day when he was at Kiev he called his body-guard:
</p>
<p>“My good brave comrades,” said he, “listen to your big brother, your Chief. Bring
a rope of silk and make a snare. Put it into the dark forest and set the snare upon
the damp earth so as to catch beasts of the forest, and catch martens and foxes, black
sables and other wild beasts, and go on snaring them for three days and three nights.”
</p>
<p>They listened to their big brother, their Chief, and they did the thing he had ordered.
They took a rope of silk to the dark forest and set a snare upon the damp earth, but
they could not catch a single beast. Then Volgá their Chief turned himself into a
lion-beast. He leapt and bounded on the damp earth, through the dark forest, and drove
out martens and foxes, black sables and other wild beasts, big bounding hares and
little ermines. And Volgá took his own form again, and became a goodly youth.
</p>
<p>And again when he was at the town of Kiev with his body-guard of brave youths he said:
</p>
<p>“My good comrades, my brave lads, listen to your big brother your Chief. Take a snare
of silk and set it in the dark forest at the very tops of the trees, and with it catch
geese, swans and bright falcons, and little singing birds, and go on snaring them
for three days and three nights.”
</p>
<p>And they listened to their big brother their Chief. They did the thing he ordered.
They took a snare of silk, set the snare in the dark forest, at the very <span class="pageNum" id="pb4">[<a href="#pb4">4</a>]</span>tops of the trees, but they could not catch a single bird.
</p>
<p>Volgá the Chief turned himself into an eagle. He flew up beneath the clouds and struck
down geese, swans, bright hawks, and little singing birds.
</p>
<p>Again when they were at the town of Kiev, Volgá the Chief said:
</p>
<p>“Good comrades, my brave body-guard, listen to your big brother, your Chief. Take
sharp axes, good for cutting wood, and build a ship of oak; take fishing nets of silk
and go forth upon the blue sea, and fish for all kinds of fish—salmon and white fish,
pike and dace, and the most precious fish—sturgeon, and go on fishing for three days
and three nights.”
</p>
<p>They listened to their big brother their Chief, and they did the thing he ordered.
They took sharp axes, good for cutting wood, and built a ship of oak. They took fishing
nets of silk, but they could not catch a single fish.
</p>
<p>Volgá the Chief turned himself into a big pike and swam in the blue sea. He sent up
salmon and white sturgeon, pike and dace, and the costly fish—sturgeon, and drove
them into the nets of his men.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>And again, when he was at Kiev with his body-guard of good comrades, Volgá the Chief
said:
</p>
<p>“My good brave comrades, why should we not send to the country of the Tartars to find
out what the Cham is thinking of? For the Cham may be thinking of something. And what
if he were thinking of riding <span class="pageNum" id="pb5">[<a href="#pb5">5</a>]</span>into Holy Russia? Now, whom shall we send? If we send an old man he will go slowly,
and we shall have long to wait. If we send a middle-aged man he will tarry and drink
by the way; and if we send a boy he will stop and play. It seems as if Volgá will
have to go himself!”
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>Then Volgá the Chief turned himself into a little bird and flew up beneath the clouds.
He flew on and soon came to the country of the Tartars. He came to the house of the
Tartar Cham and perched at the Cham’s own window and listened to his secret talk.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>The Cham said to his wife:
</p>
<p>“Now I tell you, my Queen, I know what I know. In Russia the grass grows not as it
used to grow. The flowers bloom not as before. Volgá must be dead and gone.”
</p>
<p>The Queen said:
</p>
<p>“Come now, Santal, Cham of Tartary, the grass grows in Russia just as before. The
flowers bloom in Russia just as before. I dreamed in the night—in dreams one sees
all things. It seemed that from the East, that dear country, a bird was flying—a small
singing bird—and from the West—the old country—after the little bird there flew a
black crow. They flew together over the open plain, and they were pecking at each
other, and the little singing bird was pecking the black crow, and she pulled out
his feathers, and all were carried away on the wind.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb6">[<a href="#pb6">6</a>]</span></p>
<p>And the Cham Santal of Tartary answered her: “Oh, my Queen! I am thinking of riding
soon to Holy Russia with my army, and I shall take nine cities and give them to my
nine sons, and for myself I shall bring back a costly fur coat.”
</p>
<p>But the Queen said:
</p>
<p>“You will not take nine cities or give them to your nine sons, and you will not bring
back for yourself a costly fur coat!”
</p>
<p>The Cham of Tartary answered in a rage:
</p>
<p>“Oh, you old devil! You were dreaming and saw yourself in your dream!”
</p>
<p>And he struck her on her white face, and again he struck her on the other cheek. He
threw the Queen down upon the brick floor, and threw her down a second time, and said:
</p>
<p>“I shall ride to Holy Russia; I shall take nine cities, and give them to my nine sons;
and for myself I shall bring back a costly fur coat.”
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>Volgá the Chief flew down from the window-ledge to the ground and turned himself into
a grey wolf and jumped into the stable yard. He picked out all the good horses and
tore out the throat of every one.
</p>
<p>Then Volgá turned himself into a little ermine and slipped into the armoury, where
the Cham kept a great stock of weapons for his men. Volgá broke all the tough bows,
tore out the silken bow strings, destroyed the sharp arrows, bit notches in the sharp
swords, and bent the steel maces into a bow. Then he turned <span class="pageNum" id="pb7">[<a href="#pb7">7</a>]</span>himself again into a little bird and soon flew back to Kiev town, where he turned
himself back into his own shape, and was once more a goodly youth.
</p>
<p>Volgá came to his body-guard of good comrades.
</p>
<p>“My brave comrades,” said he, “let us go to the land of the Tartars!”
</p>
<p>And they went to the land of the Tartars, and they took all the Tartar army prisoners.

<h2 class="main">MIKÚLA THE VILLAGER’S SON.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Next we come to the story of Mikúla, the villager’s son, and how he meets with Volgá
and joins his band of heroes. Young Volgá had an uncle who was a prince in the land,
and the prince gave Volgá for his own three towns, and the towns were to pay him a
yearly tribute, and so he set out with his body-guard of brave youths to collect this
tribute.
</p>
<p>Volgá set out, and as he rode through the free and open plain he heard a ploughman
in the open field. The ploughman’s plough could be heard scraping over the ground
and scrunching over the stones, but the ploughman and his plough were out of sight
on the boundless plain. Volgá rode towards the ploughman all day from morning till
evening with his brave body-guard, but he could not come up with the ploughman. And
Volgá rode on the whole of another day, another day from morning till evening, but
he could not come up with the ploughman. The ploughman was ploughing the field and
still drove on. The ploughman’s plough scraped on and the ploughshare creaked over
the stones, but still Volgá could not come within sight of him, and on the third day
Volgá and his comrades <span class="pageNum" id="pb9">[<a href="#pb9">9</a>]</span>rode from morning till midday, and at midday they came up with the ploughman in the
open field. The ploughman was ploughing in the field, and on he drove. From edge to
edge he swept the long furrows. When he reached the edge of the field he could not
see the other edge. He cast out the stumps and stones, and all the large stones he
piled up in a trench.
</p>
<p>The ploughman had a light bay mare, and the stock of his plough was of maple wood.
His mare was harnessed with ropes of silk.
</p>
<p>When Volgá came up with the ploughman he spoke to him and said:
</p>
<p>“God help thee, good ploughman, to plough the field and till the ground, and to do
thy labour, to sweep the furrows from edge to edge of the field, and to turn out the
stumps and stones from the ground.”
</p>
<p>The ploughman looked at Volgá and said:
</p>
<p>“Here comes Volgá with his brave body-guard! Yes, I need the help of God to do my
peasant’s work! Is it far thou goest, Volgá, and whither dost thou go with thy brave
body-guard?”
</p>
<p>“Well, good ploughman, I am going to town to collect the tribute. First I go to Gurchevitz
town, and next I am going to Orechovitz, and then to a third town, Krestyanovitz.”
</p>
<p>“Well, my Lord Volgá,” said the ploughman, “I was in town not long since on my bay
mare, and I brought away with me from the town two bags of <span class="pageNum" id="pb10">[<a href="#pb10">10</a>]</span>salt, only two bags of salt, each of fourteen hundred pounds weight, and the peasants
there are all thieves; they asked me for threepence for toll. But I had my whip for
the journey, and I paid them their toll with my whip.”
</p>
<p>“Now come with me, good ploughman,” said Volgá, “come and join my body-guard!”
</p>
<p>And the good ploughman straightway unfastened his ropes of silk, took his mare from
the plough, and got on her back.
</p>
<p>Volgá’s body-guard were all mounted on their good horses and were setting off, but
the ploughman stopped Volgá and said:
</p>
<p>“Now, Volgá, I left the plough in the furrow; would it not be better to pull the plough
out of the ground and shake the earth from the ploughshare, and throw the plough behind
the broom bush? Not for fear of any passing travellers who might take it, but on account
of the good-for-nothings in the village who might meddle with my plough.”
</p>
<p>Young Volgá ordered five strong young men out of his brave body-guard to pull the
plough out of the ground, to shake the earth from the ploughshare, and throw the plough
behind the broom bush. The five strong young men rode up to the plough of maple wood,
they turned the plough about by the shaft, but could not pull the plough out of the
ground, or shake the earth from the ploughshare, and throw the plough behind the broom
bush.
</p>
<p></p>

</div><p>
</p>
<p>Young Volgá then sent from his brave body-guard a whole half-score to pull the plough
out of the ground, <span class="pageNum" id="pb13">[<a href="#pb13">13</a>]</span>to shake the earth from the ploughshare, and throw the plough behind the broom bush.
They turned the plough round by the shaft, but could not pull the plough out of the
ground, or shake the earth from the ploughshare, or throw the plough behind the broom
bush.
</p>
<p>Young Volgá then sent his whole brave body-guard to pull the plough out of the ground,
shake the earth from the ploughshare, and throw the plough behind the broom bush,
but, though they tried their hardest, they could not pull the plough out of the ground,
or shake the earth from the ploughshare, and throw the plough behind the broom bush.
Then the good ploughman came riding up upon his light bay mare to this plough of maple
wood. He took hold of the plough with one hand, pulled the plough out of the ground,
shook the earth from the ploughshare, and threw the plough into the broom bush.
</p>
<p>Again they all mounted their good steeds and rode on. The ploughman’s mare went on
at a trot, but Volgá’s horse had to gallop to try to get up to the ploughman’s mare,
and Volgá’s horse was left behind. Volgá began to wave his cap, and he shouted:
</p>
<p>“Stop, good ploughman. If that mare of yours were a horse, I would give five hundred
for that mare.”
</p>
<p>The ploughman answered him:
</p>
<p>“Stupid is Volgá, the son of Svyátoslav. I took the mare as a foal from the dam, and
I paid five hundred for that mare when she was a foal. If the mare were a horse, she
would be priceless!”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb14">[<a href="#pb14">14</a>]</span></p>
<p>Said Volgá, the son of Svyátoslav:
</p>
<p>“Here, good ploughman-farmer, by what name art thou called? What is thy father’s name,
and whence comest thou?”
</p>
<p>And the ploughman answered him:
</p>
<p>“Well now, Volgá, son of Svyátoslav, I plough the fields for rye, I build my ricks,
I stack my corn, I lead it home; when I’ve brought it home, I grind the corn, I split
wood, and I brew beer. When I have brewed beer I give it to the peasants to drink.
And the peasants call me Young Mikúla, the villager’s son!”

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was once a great Russian Hero who was so big and strong that no one could stand
up against him, and he fancied that with his great strength he could do anything.
</p>
<p>One day he made up his mind to go out for a ride on the plain, the great open plain
in Russia, where one can ride for miles without seeing anything but the long waving
feather grass.
</p>
<p>He saddled and bridled his good horse, got upon his back and rode out on the open
plain. In his heart he was glad; yes, he was glad—yes, and overflowing with strength,
and he said to himself:
</p>
<p>“So strong do I feel that if I could find something to take hold of I could lift up
the whole world!”
</p>
<p>He rode on a long way and presently saw another man on horseback ahead of him. The
man did not look round, but he let fall a small wallet such as a man often carries
across his shoulder or across his horse. Svyatogór saw it lying on the road and tried
to push it away with the end of his whip; it did not move. He bent over and touched
the wallet with his fingers, but he could not move it. He stooped down from his <span class="pageNum" id="pb16">[<a href="#pb16">16</a>]</span>horse and grasped the wallet with his hand, but he could not lift it.
</p>
<p>“Many years have I journeyed upon this earth,” said he, “but never have I come upon
so strange a thing. Such a wonder have I never seen. A little wallet, a bag, that
will not be pushed away, that cannot be moved out of the way, and that cannot be lifted
up!”
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>The hero got off his good horse, stooped and grasped the bag with both hands; he lifted
it a little higher than his knees, but he sank down into the earth as far as his knees,
and, not tears, but blood, ran down his white face, and as he sank down he could not
rise again.
</p>
<p>The man who was riding in front turned round and rode back to him.
</p>
<p>Svyatogór asked:
</p>
<p>“What was in that wallet to make it so heavy?”
</p>
<p>The man answered:
</p>
<p>“The weight of the whole world.”
</p>
<p>“Who art thou?” asked Svyatogór.
</p>
<p>“I am Mikúla, the villager’s son.”

<h2 class="main">SVYATOGÓR AND ILYÁ OF MÚROM.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Near the town of Múrom in Russia there lived long ago a farmer called Iván, with his
wife and family. He and his wife and his sons and daughters worked hard in the fields,
all but one son, Ilyá, who was always sitting at home. For thirty years Ilyá had been
sitting at home because he could use neither hands nor feet.
</p>
<p>One day he was sitting by the window as usual, when two wandering pilgrims came passing
by. They were both too lame and old to work, but they had made the pilgrimage to the
Holy Land and now walked about the country singing psalms and living upon the food
and money that kind folk gave them. They saw Ilyá at his window and called out:
</p>
<p>“Ilyá! Ilyá of Múrom, open wide the gate for the pilgrims; let us into thy house.”
</p>
<p>Ilyá of Múrom answered:
</p>
<p>“Well now, good pilgrims, I cannot open the gate, for I have been sitting here these
thirty years. I can use neither hands nor feet.”
</p>
<p>Again the pilgrims called to him:
</p>
<p>“O Ilyá, rise up upon thy nimble feet. Open wide the gates and let the pilgrims in
to visit thee in thy house.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb18">[<a href="#pb18">18</a>]</span></p>
<p>Ilyá stood up upon his feet, as though nothing ailed him. He opened wide the gates
and let the pilgrims into the house. They came in, crossing themselves like good Russians,
and bowed low when they were in the room.
</p>
<p>“Pray give us a drink, Ilyá,” they said.
</p>
<p>Ilyá brought them a large bowl of honey drink; it held about a pailful and a half,
and he offered it to the pilgrims. They took it and drank, and then offered it to
Ilyá. He drank the bowlful and felt a rush of warmth throughout his body, his hero’s
heart burned within him.
</p>
<p>“What dost thou feel, O Ilyá?” asked the pilgrims.
</p>
<p>Ilyá bowed to the ground before the pilgrims and answered:
</p>
<p>“I feel great strength within me.”
</p>
<p>“Bring another drink, Ilyá,” said the pilgrims.
</p>
<p>And Ilyá brought another cupful, and offered it to the pilgrims. They offered it to
Ilyá, and Ilyá emptied the cup without drawing breath.
</p>
<p>“How dost thou feel now, Ilyá?” asked the pilgrims.
</p>
<p>“I feel great strength, but only half as much as before,” answered he.
</p>
<p>Then the wandering pilgrims said:
</p>
<p></p>
<div class="figure p019width" id="p019"><img src="images/p019.png" alt="ИЛЬѦ МУРОМЄЦЪ КРЄСТЬѦНCКІИ CЫНЪ.IL′IA MUROMET͡S KREST′IANCKĪI CYN." width="720" height="502"><p class="figureHead"><span class="trans" title="IL′IA MUROMET͡S KREST′IANCKĪI CYN."><span lang="ru" class="cyrl">ИЛЬѦ МУРОМЄЦЪ КРЄСТЬѦНCКІИ CЫНЪ.</span></span></p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>“O Ilyá, thou wilt be a great hero, and it is not written that thou shouldst die in
battle. Fight thou with all the heroes and the bold warrior women of the plain, and
defend thyself against them; only go not out to fight with the hero Svyatogór, for
with his <span class="pageNum" id="pb21">[<a href="#pb21">21</a>]</span>strength he could carry the earth; and fight not with the hero Samson, for he has
upon his head seven hairs of angels; also fight not with the race of Mikúla, for damp
Mother Earth loves him. Neither go after Volgá, son of Svyátoslav; he will overcome
thee, not by force, but by craft and wisdom. Now rise up, O Ilyá, mount thy horse,
and ride out into the free and open plain. Buy the first foal thou seest with its
dam, and in three months’ time thou mayst put on the saddle. Feed him on millet and
maize; walk him about for three months, then keep him for three nights in the garden,
and roll the foal three mornings in the dew. Lead him to a high fence, and when he
will readily leap the fence both from this side and the other, then ride him where
thou wilt, he will carry thee.”
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>Then the pilgrims vanished, and presently Ilyá’s father and mother came in from their
work in the fields. His brother and sisters came in also from their work, and his
father and mother were glad indeed to see that Ilyá could walk as if nothing had ever
ailed him. Then from joy they became sad again, and said:
</p>
<p>“Thirty years has Ilyá been sitting on the bench as if he had neither hands nor feet!”
</p>
<p>And Ilyá said to his father:
</p>
<p>“Where have you been working to-day, father?”
</p>
<p>But his parents only said:
</p>
<p>“Glory to Thee, O Lord! Thirty years has Ilyá been sitting by the stove, and was he
not without hands or feet?”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb22">[<a href="#pb22">22</a>]</span></p>
<p>And Ilyá asked again:
</p>
<p>“But you, father and mother, where have you been working on the farm?”
</p>
<p>“Well, Ilyá,” answered his father, “we are working in the field by the stream; we
are clearing it for ploughing. It is the field three fields from home.”
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>After they had dined Ilyá said to his parents:
</p>
<p>“Now, dear father and mother, take me to the water meadow. Show me my bit of work.”
</p>
<p>And his parents took him down to the water meadow, and Ilyá said:
</p>
<p>“Show me how far you will plough here,” and they showed him the boundary and sat down
to rest.
</p>
<p>But Ilyá seized the brushwood by handfuls and cut it down by the roots and threw it
all on to a pile on the edge of the field. And he worked so hard and so fast that
the field was cleared in a quarter of the time that it would have taken his father
to finish the work. The father and mother were asleep, for they were tired by the
long morning’s work, but they awoke when Ilyá came towards them, saying:
</p>
<p>“Come, father and mother, is not your field well cleared for the ploughing? Now I
must say good-bye to home!”
</p>
<p>Then Ilyá saddled his good horse and put on the bridle, and his father and mother
gave him their farewell blessing.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>

</div><p>
</p>
<p>He rode away through the open plain till at last <span class="pageNum" id="pb25">[<a href="#pb25">25</a>]</span>he came to a high mountain. When he reached the high mountain he climbed up it and
then lay down to rest, and he slept for twelve days the sleep of a hero. When he awoke
he saw at a distance a white tent standing beneath a tree. He mounted his horse again
and rode a long way through the plain towards the white tent. This tent stood beneath
the shade of a great green oak tree upon another hill. In the tent was a great bed
seventy feet long and forty-two feet wide. Ilyá tied up his horse to the oak tree
and lay down upon that hero’s bed, and went to sleep. Now the sleep of a hero is sound,
and Ilyá slept for three days and three nights.
</p>
<p>On the third day his good horse heard a terrible noise from the north. Mother Earth
rocked, the dark forest shook, the rivers overflowed their steep banks. Ilyá’s good
horse struck the ground with his hoofs, but could not waken Ilyá of Múrom. At last
the horse spoke to him in a human voice:
</p>
<p>“O Ilyá of Múrom! thou knowest not that danger is near thee. The hero Svyatogór is
coming to his tent. Let me loose that I may flee across the open plain, and thou mayest
climb up into the green oak tree.”
</p>
<p>Ilyá untied his horse’s bridle and set the good horse free to gallop across the plain;
and then he climbed up into the oak tree. From the oak tree he saw the hero Svyatogór
coming on his great horse. The hero was taller than a standing forest, and his head
nearly touched a moving cloud. On his shoulder he carried <span class="pageNum" id="pb26">[<a href="#pb26">26</a>]</span>a great chest of glass. He came down from his horse and placed the chest on the ground
and opened it with a golden key. Out of the chest came the hero’s wife. So lovely
was she that no such beauty had ever been seen or heard of in the whole white world.
</p>
<p>Very tall she was and elegant, and delicately did she walk. She had eyes like the
eyes of a bright falcon, eyebrows of black sable, and waving black hair. As soon as
she came out of the great chest she set to work to lay the table for her husband’s
dinner. She spread a bright chequered table-cloth and took from the chest a bottle
of honey drink and a cup and sweetmeats full many, and placed them upon the chequered
cloth.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>After he had eaten and drunk, Svyatogór lay down to sleep on his great bed in the
tent, but his wife went to walk on the open plain. She caught sight of Ilyá in the
oak tree and would have him to come down and talk to her. When her husband suddenly
woke up she put Ilyá into her husband’s pocket to hide him. Svyatogór stood up and
put his wife back into the glass chest and lifted it on to his shoulder again. He
called up his horse and got upon his back and set off to ride, but soon the horse
stumbled, and Svyatogór was vexed and asked why he was stumbling.
</p>
<p>“This morning,” said the horse in a human voice, “I was carrying a hero and a hero’s
wife, but now I am carrying two heroes as well as the hero’s wife.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb27">[<a href="#pb27">27</a>]</span></p>
<p>Svyatogór looked round and saw no one, but putting his hand into his pocket there
he found Ilyá. The hero asked Ilyá whence he came. Ilyá told him the truth, and Svyatogór
was exceeding angry and killed his wife for trying to deceive him.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>That Ilyá had dealt straightly pleased the hero Svyatogór, and there arose a great
friendship between them. Svyatogór exchanged crosses with Ilyá in token of friendship,
and called Ilyá his younger brother. He taught Ilyá all the handling of weapons, how
to use his mace and his bow and arrows and spear in fighting, and also all the ways
of travel of the heroes. Ilyá had called up his good horse from the plain by a loud
whistle, and the two heroes, the old Svyatogór and the younger Ilyá of Múrom, rode
on together through the open plain till they came to a great tomb built of stone.
Upon the tomb was written these words:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“He who is fated to lie in this tomb will exactly fit it.”</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>Ilyá lay down in the tomb, but it was too long and too wide for him, and at once he
sprang out of it.
</p>
<p>The giant hero Svyatogór lay down there, and the tomb just fitted him.
</p>
<p>“The tomb is just made for me,” said the hero. “Take the lid of the tomb, Ilyá, and
cover me.”
</p>
<p>Ilyá answered:
<span class="pageNum" id="pb28">[<a href="#pb28">28</a>]</span></p>
<p>“I will not take up the lid of the tomb, O, my big brother. I will not cover thee.
This is a foolish jest of thine—thou wilt bury thyself.”
</p>
<p>And Svyatogór took the lid and covered himself up in the tomb, but when he tried to
lift the lid off again he could not move it. He struggled and strove to lift it, but
could do nothing. Then he called to Ilyá:
</p>
<p>“O, my young brother! It seems that my fate has found me. I cannot raise the lid.
Try thou to lift it.”
</p>
<p>Ilyá of Múrom tried hard to raise the cover, but what could he do?
</p>
<p>Then said Svyatogór the hero:
</p>
<p>“Take my sword of steel and strike across the lid of the tomb.”
</p>
<p>Ilyá tried to lift Svyatogór’s great sword, but could not—it was too heavy for him—and
he had to say:
</p>
<p>“I cannot lift thy sword, O, my brother!”
</p>
<p>Svyatogór then called to him:
</p>
<p>“My little brother, bend down to this small chink in the tomb, and I will breathe
upon thee the spirit of a hero.”
</p>
<p>Ilyá bent down to the chink and Svyatogór the hero breathed upon him his hero’s spirit.
Ilyá felt that his former strength had become three times as great as before. He took
the sword of steel and struck a blow across the lid of the tomb. By this blow sparks
were struck, but on the place where he struck the lid there grew a band of iron.
</p>
<p>The hero Svyatogór called to him again, saying:
<span class="pageNum" id="pb29">[<a href="#pb29">29</a>]</span></p>
<p>“My young brother, I am suffocating; try again to strike the lid lengthwise.”
</p>
<p>Ilyá struck the cover lengthwise with the great sword, but again where he struck there
grew a band of iron.
</p>
<p>Then the hero Svyatogór spoke to him, saying:
</p>
<p>“My young brother, I am suffocating. Stoop down to the chink and I will breathe upon
thee and will give thee all my great strength.”
</p>
<p>But Ilyá answered:
</p>
<p>“If I had all thy strength, O, my big brother, Earth would not bear me.”
</p>
<p>Then said the hero Svyatogór:
</p>
<p>“Thou hast done well, little brother, in that thou didst not do my last bidding. I
should have breathed upon thee with the breath of the dead, and thou wouldst have
lain dead by me. Now, farewell; take my sword of steel, but lead my good horse to
my tomb; none but I must own that horse.”
</p>
<p>Then came from the chink the last breath of the hero. Ilyá said farewell to his friend,
girded on his sword of steel, but left the hero’s horse by his master’s tomb, and
he rode away into the free and open plain.

<p class="first">Ilyá had made up his mind to go to Kiev town to seek service with the gracious Prince
Vladímir, but before setting out on that long journey he wished to see his father
again and ask for his blessing, so he rode back to Múrom and to his old home. He found
his old father there and greeted him, saying:
</p>
<p>“Come thou, my own dear Father! I am here to ask for thy blessing. I go to glorious,
royal Kiev town to pray at the sanctuary of Kiev and to pledge myself to Vladímir
the Prince, to serve him in faith and in truth, and to uphold the Christian faith.”
</p>
<p>The old farmer Iván blessed Ilyá and said:
</p>
<p>“I give thee my blessing for the good work, but for evil work no blessing I give.
Go thou on the right road, and do no harm to any woman whether she be Christian or
Tartar.”
</p>
<p>Ilyá of Múrom bowed to the earth before his father, and said farewell to his mother
and his sisters and brothers, and then he mounted his good horse and rode <span class="pageNum" id="pb31">[<a href="#pb31">31</a>]</span>through the open plain. With his whip he struck his horse on the curved hind quarter
and his restive steed was wroth and suddenly sprang from the earth and bounded higher
than an upright tree, almost as high as a moving cloud. At the first bound he passed
twelve miles, at the second bound he came to a well. By the well Ilyá cut down a green
oak tree, and beside the well he built a small chapel, and upon the chapel he wrote
his name,
</p>
<p class="xd31e105">ILYÁ OF MÚROM, SON OF IVÁN,
</p>
<p>so that if some strong and mighty hero should ride that way, he should know the name
of the builder of that chapel.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>At the third bound Ilyá’s horse brought him to the town of Chérnigov. Near Chérnigov
there stood a countless host of Tartars, and at their head were three Princes, each
with the strength of forty thousand. On seeing this vast horde the hero’s heart grew
hot within him, and he could not control his longing to fight. His heart was filled
with fires, and it burned too as if scorched by frost. Then he spoke and said:
</p>
<p>“I desire not to go against my father’s wish, or knowingly to disregard his command.”
</p>
<p>Then he took in his hand his battle-sword and taught it to take a walk through the
army. Where he turned, it opened out a street, and when he turned round there was
a great open space. Ilyá made his way to the three princes, and spoke thus to them:

<p>“Come, my three king’s sons! Shall I take you away as prisoners, or shall I cut off
your warlike heads? If I take you away as prisoners, I must travel over roads that
I know not and must carry bread, but if I take off your heads the kingly race will
be destroyed. If you will go home to your own country, you will spread such report
of me that it will be known all over Russia, and you will tell it everywhere that
in Holy Russia there are strong and mighty heroes.”
</p>
<p>The Governor of Chérnigov saw Ilyá and said:
</p>
<p>“This Lord has vanquished our tyrant and cleansed our glorious city of Chérnigov,”
and he spoke to his princes and nobles and said:
</p>
<p>“Go ye and call in this goodly hero to eat bread and salt with me.”
</p>
<p>And the princes and nobles came forth to greet Ilyá of Múrom and said:
</p>
<p>“Come now, thou stalwart and goodly hero, and tell us by what honoured name thou art
called, and what is thy renowned father’s name?”
</p>
<p>“They call me by the name of Ilyá, but I am honoured as the son of Iván,” said Ilyá.
</p>
<p>“Come, Ilyá of Múrom,” said the princes and nobles, “come to our Governor, he sends
us to invite thee to eat bread and salt with him.”
</p>
<p>But Ilyá wished to be on the way to Kiev and answered with little ceremony:
</p>
<p>“I will not come to your Governor; I wish not to eat bread and salt with him. Show
me the straight road to glorious, royal Kiev town.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb33">[<a href="#pb33">33</a>]</span></p>
<p>So they had to let him go on his way, and they showed him the straight road to Kiev
across the open plain.
</p>
<p>Farther, farther upon on the open plain waves the feather grass in the breeze, and
there upon the open plain, among old folk, mothers and men, rode the Old Cossack,
Ilyá of Múrom, and the horse he rode was like a fierce wild beast and he himself like
a bright falcon.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>Now the old hero carried no money, only seven thousand golden ducats had he with him,
and of small money, forty thousand pieces. And the horse the hero rode was priceless.
Why was the hero’s horse priceless? Because these was no price for the horse.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>When he came to a river he looked for no ford. Now the river was a full mile wide,
but the good steed leapt from bank to bank. Then Ilyá saw a village near by and the
villagers—brigands, as we say in our Russian tongue—rode out after the hero. They
swept round him and tried to rob him, tried to part him from his life and soul.
</p>
<p>Then said Ilyá of Múrom, son of Iván:
</p>
<p>“Oh come, brother villagers, no reason have ye to kill an old man like me. And ye
shall take nothing from the old man.”
</p>
<p>He took from his saddle his tough bow and brought out from his quiver a sharp arrow.
He bent his bow and fitted the arrow to the silken string, and <span class="pageNum" id="pb34">[<a href="#pb34">34</a>]</span>shot—not at the village folk—brigands though they were—for he would have been loth
to slay them, but he shot at the green oak tree; and the bowstring sang in the tough
bow, the villagers fell from their horses, the arrow struck the crackling green oak
tree and shattered the oak into chips and shavings. By this heroic deed of thunder
the brigand villagers were filled with fear, and for five hours they lay without sense,
and Ilyá made sport of them.
</p>
<p>“Come, come, good youths, you village brigands! Why do you lie half the night there
upon the damp earth? Why go off to sleep and sleep half the night? On my way here
I passed many people both on horseback and on foot; you have let many a good chance
escape you.”
</p>
<p>The goodly youths stood up upon their nimble feet and threw themselves at Ilyá’s feet
and said:
</p>
<p>“O thou brave hero! come and join our band and be thou our chieftain.”
</p>
<p>The good hero, Ilyá of Múrom, answered them:
</p>
<p>“I desire not to join your band; I am on my way to Kiev town, to Vladímir the Prince,
to help him, and to fight and defend him.”
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>The bold hero rode on through the open plain till he came to a pillar of white oak.
On the pillar this writing was written:
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“To ride straight on—only five hundred miles, </p>
<p class="line">But making a round—seven hundred miles.” </p>
</div>
<p><span class="pageNum" id="pb35">[<a href="#pb35">35</a>]</span></p>
<p>Ilyá looked at this writing and said:
</p>
<p>“If I ride straight, I shall cease to live; this way I can neither ride nor walk nor
fly. Nightingale the Robber sits in his nest upon the seven oaks, and the robber-dog
will seize me at the seventh mile.”
</p>
<p>Ilyá stood still to think what he should do.
</p>
<p>“The straight horse-road is broken up, the little bridge of white hazel is broken
down. It would be no honour to me, or glory to my knighthood to ride by that roundabout
way. It is better to ride by the straight road.”
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>At once he got down from his good steed; with one hand he led his horse, while with
the other he put planks across the stream for a bridge—that bridge of white hazel.
</p>
<p>The straight road he mended, and he rode on till he came near the clump of seven oak
trees upon which Nightingale the Robber had built his great nest.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>Nightingale the Robber was sitting upon his nest of twisted boughs upon the seven
oak trees, and Ilyá rode up to the oak trees. The robber-dog tried to seize him just
as he had come to the seventh mile, and Nightingale the Robber roared like a wild
aurochs, and the villain whistled like a nightingale, and the robber-dog howled like
a dog.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>And at these sounds Ilyá’s good steed fell upon his knees with terror at the roar
of the aurochs, <span class="pageNum" id="pb36">[<a href="#pb36">36</a>]</span>and the whistle of the nightingale, and the dog-like howling of the robber-dog. Ilyá
struck his horse between the ears and also struck him upon the flank, saying:
</p>
<p>“Oh thou food for wolves, thou grass-bag! Hast thou never heard the roar of an aurochs?
and hast thou never heard the whistle of a nightingale, and the howling of a robber-dog?”
</p>
<p>The hero did not sit still but quickly bent his strong bow, took a sharp arrow from
his quiver and shot the arrow at Nightingale the Robber as he sat there in his nest
on the seven oak trees. The arrow hit Nightingale the Robber in the right eye and
came out at the left ear, and Nightingale the Robber fell from his nest down upon
the damp earth.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>Then Ilyá took Nightingale the Robber and tied him to his Circassian stirrup and made
him walk beside the horse towards Kiev town. Presently they came to the house of Nightingale
the Robber. It was a big house in a large yard, and round the yard was a high iron
fence with spikes on the railings, and upon every spike was set the head of a hero;
for Nightingale the Robber killed all that passed that way.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>Nightingale’s children caught sight of their father and called out:
</p>
<p>“Look! father is bringing a man.”
</p>
<p>And Nightingale’s young wife looked from the window and said:
<span class="pageNum" id="pb37">[<a href="#pb37">37</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>
<div class="figure p037width" id="p037"><img src="images/p037.png" alt="СТРѢЛИЛЪ ТО СОЛОВБѦ РАЗВОНИНКА.STRI͡eLIL TO SOLOVBIA RAZVONINKA." width="499" height="720"><p class="figureHead"><span class="trans" title="STRI͡eLIL TO SOLOVBIA RAZVONINKA."><span lang="ru" class="cyrl">СТРѢЛИЛЪ ТО СОЛОВБѦ РАЗВОНИНКА.</span></span></p>
</div><p>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb39">[<a href="#pb39">39</a>]</span></p>
<p>“A strange man is carrying off your dear father.”
</p>
<p>And she called to some men who were idling about the yard and said:
</p>
<p>“Will you not take him from this wanderer on the road? Is your dear father nothing
to you? He has fallen into the power of this horseman. It would be better to take
a cup full of red gold, and another of pure silver, and a third cup full of round
pearls. Go now and offer them as a ransom. Speak to this horseman and persuade him.
Coax him and talk him over so that he may release Nightingale.”
</p>
<p>And they rushed into the house, and Nightingale’s wife took the keys and went down
to the deep vaults where all Nightingale’s treasure was stored, and they filled a
cup full of red gold, and another with pure silver, and a third with round pearls,
and they went out to Ilyá with flattering words and tried to coax him and talk him
over, saying:
</p>
<p>“O thou bold hero, good youth, give us back our dear father and we will give thee
gold and silver!”
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>Ilyá received these messengers and talked to them thus:
</p>
<p>“Look here, brothers, you who work for gain, I will not give you your dear father;
he would only turn brigand again and rob the travellers passing this way.”
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>And Ilyá rode on to Kiev town with Nightingale the Robber by his side, still tied
to the stirrup so that <span class="pageNum" id="pb40">[<a href="#pb40">40</a>]</span>he could not run away. Ilyá hurried on, for he would fain be at Kiev in time for the
service on Easter morning; but he could not get there in time. When he reached Kiev
he rode into the wide courtyard of the Prince’s palace. He tied up his good horse
to the gold ring on a carven pillar, but did not take off either the saddle or the
bridle, and he left Nightingale the Robber still tied to the stirrup.
</p>
<p>Then Ilyá walked quickly through the new entrance, through the guard room and into
the hall. There he crossed himself like a good Russian, and made his bow as he came
into the hall. The steward of Vladímir the Prince he greeted, and asked him:
</p>
<p>“Where is the Prince Vladímir of royal Kiev?”
</p>
<p>“Prince Vladímir has gone to Mass,” was the answer.
</p>
<p>Ilyá sat down on the plain wooden bench to wait, and in a short time Prince Vladímir
came in with his nobles and attendants from the Easter service.
</p>
<p>Then they all gave greetings one to the other, and each hero greeted the other, and
Vladímir spoke to Ilyá and said:
</p>
<p>“All hail to thee, brave youth, I know not thy name or thy father’s name. Art thou
a Tsar or a Tsar’s son? Art thou a king or a king’s son?”
</p>
<p>Ilyá answered and said:
</p>
<p>“I am from the town of Múrom. I am the old Cossack, Ilyá of Múrom.”
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p></p>
<div class="figure p041width" id="p041"><img src="images/p041.png" alt="ПОѢХАЛЪ ИЛЬѦ КО ГОРОДУ КО КЇЄВУ.POI͡eKHAL IL′IA KO GORODU KO KÏEVU." width="522" height="720"><p class="figureHead"><span class="trans" title="POI͡eKHAL IL′IA KO GORODU KO KÏEVU."><span lang="ru" class="cyrl">ПОѢХАЛЪ ИЛЬѦ КО ГОРОДУ КО КЇЄВУ.</span></span></p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>And they all sat down at the table to eat bread, <span class="pageNum" id="pb43">[<a href="#pb43">43</a>]</span>and they carved and ate white swans, and Ilyá began to talk and to boast of what he
had done.
</p>
<p>“I am a brave hero, I have been riding through the eve of Easter Day. I would fain
have been in time for the Easter Mass, but I could not get here in time for Easter
morning, for the hour was past. I rode here by the straight road, and when I reached
the green oaks, Nightingale the Robber was sitting upon the seven oaks. That ill-doer
used to seize upon every one for seven miles round. When I came near the oaks Nightingale
roared like a wild aurochs, and the villain whistled like a nightingale, and the robber-dog
howled like a dog. Then my good horse fell upon his knees with fear, but I took out
my tough bow, set the sharp arrow, and shot Nightingale the Robber. I shot the villain
through the right eye, and the arrow came out by the left ear. Then Nightingale fell
upon the damp earth, and I took the robber and fastened him to my Circassian stirrup
and brought the villain with me.”
</p>
<p>Vladímir the Prince looked at Ilyá and said:
</p>
<p>“It seems to me, my bold youth, that there must be a big tavern in this country! Hast
thou been drinking strong drink? Art thou not making empty boasts, good hero?”
</p>
<p>Ilyá’s wrath grew hot within him, and angrily he said:
</p>
<p>“Thou it is who art the fool, O Prince of royal Kiev! I have Nightingale the Robber
here, tied to my Circassian stirrup.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb44">[<a href="#pb44">44</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then all sprang up and rushed out, hurried and stumbled against each other as they
ran out to see Nightingale the Robber. They all spoke and shouted together and called
out to him:
</p>
<p>“O thou Nightingale the Robber! Roar, O Nightingale, like an aurochs! Thou evil doer,
whistle like a nightingale! O thou robber-dog, howl like a dog!”
</p>
<p>Nightingale the Robber looked up and said:
</p>
<p>“With you I neither eat nor drink, and I will not obey you.”
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>At once the crowd of courtiers turned back to the hall and came to Ilyá of Múrom,
bowed low to him and craved their boon:
</p>
<p>“O Ilyá of Múrom, we beg thee to make Nightingale the Robber roar like an aurochs,
and make the villain whistle like a nightingale, and make the robber-dog howl like
a dog.”
</p>
<p>And Ilyá spoke to the Prince and said:
</p>
<p>“O Vladímir, Prince of royal Kiev! Nightingale’s lips are now sealed together and
his mouth is filled with dried blood, for my arrow went through his right eye and
it came out by the left ear. Pray let a bowl of strong drink be poured out for him—a
bowl weighing half a hundredweight, a bowl holding four gallons, and let it be given
to Nightingale.”
</p>
<p>And they poured him out a bowl of strong drink—a bowl weighing half a hundredweight,
a bowl holding four gallons; and they took it to Nightingale the <span class="pageNum" id="pb45">[<a href="#pb45">45</a>]</span>Robber. He took the bowl in one hand, drank off the bowl of strong drink at one draught,
and spoke these words:
</p>
<p>“Pour out another bowl of strong beer—a bowl weighing half a hundredweight, a bowl
holding four gallons, and pour out a third bowl of sweet mead—a bowl weighing half
a hundredweight, a bowl holding four gallons.”
</p>
<p>And they poured out a bowlful of strong beer, and they poured out a bowlful of sweet
mead and brought both to Nightingale the Robber. He took the bowl with one hand and
drank off the bowlful at one draught. And then Nightingale the Robber was drunken,
and Ilyá of Múrom said to him:
</p>
<p>“Now, Nightingale! Roar, thou robber, like an aurochs; whistle, O villain, like a
nightingale; and howl, O dog, like a dog.”
</p>
<p>And Nightingale the Robber roared like an aurochs<span class="corr" id="xd31e929" title="Not in source">,</span> the villain whistled like a nightingale, and the robber-dog howled like a dog.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>Princes and nobles all lay for dead, but Vladímir the Prince of royal Kiev stood up
straight and went up to Ilyá, for the Prince had a boon to ask:
</p>
<p>“Silence Nightingale the Robber, lest he whistle again like a nightingale, and my
nobles leave me here alone.”

<h2 class="label">VI.</h2>
<h2 class="main">THE THREE WAYS.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">One day Ilyá set off on his good horse for a ride. He rode a long way through the
open plain till he came to the Burning Stone. Three lengths beyond the stone there
were three paths leading this way and that from the Burning Stone, and upon the stone
was written:
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Who goes by the first path will be killed. </p>
<p class="line">Who goes by the second path will find marriage. </p>
<p class="line">Who goes by the third path will become rich.” </p>
</div>
<p class="first">He stopped to consider:
</p>
<p>“By which path shall I go? Why should a bold hero want to be rich? Why should I want
to marry? I will take the way to be killed.”
</p>
<p>So he took that way and rode on for three hours, and he rode three hundred miles,
and then he came to a hill, and at that hill, that high hill, brigands began to come
up, and there came up forty thousand brigands. They began to defy our bold hero, and
the brave Cossack spoke and hailed them:
</p>
<p>“Come, you forty thousand robbers! What will you take from me, the bold hero? I have
not many <span class="pageNum" id="pb47">[<a href="#pb47">47</a>]</span>chests of uncounted gold, I have no beautiful young wives, I have no fine clothes,
I have nothing but a good horse, a good horse which cost three hundred; on the horse
are trappings worth five hundred; on myself a hero’s gear worth a cool thousand.”
</p>
<p>When he drew his iron mace of three tons weight, he began to defy the robbers, and
he killed the forty thousand robbers.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>Then the bold hero turned back, and when he reached the Burning Stone he altered the
writing thus:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“If thou goest by this road thou wilt not be killed.”</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>And he said:
</p>
<p>“I shall go by the road to marriage.”
</p>
<p>So Ilyá took the second path and rode on for just three hundred miles. He rode on
always through the plain, that open plain, through the open plain, the green meadow,
through those open plains and through green meadows till he came to a wonderful and
a strange thing. If we called it a town it would be too small; if we called it a village
it would seem too large, but there stood a palace built of white stone. When Ilyá
reached the broad palace yard there came a most beautiful young princess from the
palace of white stone. She came to meet the brave hero and took him by his white hands,
kissed him with her sweet lips, <span class="pageNum" id="pb48">[<a href="#pb48">48</a>]</span>led him into the white stone palace, and made him sit down at the oaken table, where
a feast was spread. Ilyá ate and drank in plenty, and stuffed himself the whole day
long till evening, when he rose up from the oaken table and spoke to the princess
and said:
</p>
<p>“O thou enchanting and beautiful lady, where are thy warm sleeping chambers? Where
are the beds of carved wood? Where are the soft feather beds? I am an old man and
weary, and I would fain sleep.”
</p>
<p>And the princess led him to a warm chamber, but the old man stood by the bed and shook
his head and said:
</p>
<p>“Much have I travelled through Holy Russia, but so strange a thing have I never seen.
It seems to me that that bed is a trap.”
</p>
<p>Suddenly he seized the princess by her white hands and threw her against the brick
wall against which the bed stood. The bed of carved wood turned over and the princess
fell down into a deep dungeon below.
</p>
<p>The old Cossack walked out of the palace, and outside he found the door of the deep
dungeon. Then he took the golden keys, went on and unlocked the deep dungeon and set
free many goodly youths and brave, and many strong and mighty heroes, but the beautiful
and wicked enchantress was killed. And all the rich treasure which Ilyá found there
in that white stone palace he bestowed on the good youths and brave, and on the strong
and mighty heroes. But that white stone palace he gave to the flames.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb49">[<a href="#pb49">49</a>]</span></p>
<p>And then our bold hero rode back again, and when he came to the Burning Stone he again
altered the graven letters and wrote:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“By that way I went—I was not married.”</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>“I go,” said he, “by the third path, where one will become rich.”
</p>
<p>And on he rode for three hours, three hundred miles he rode, and again he rode through
the plain, the open plain, the meadow, the green meadow, to a place where there were
sunk deep pits in the ground, all piled up with red gold—red gold, pure silver, and
fine round pearls.
</p>
<p>Ilyá looked at the gold and said:
</p>
<p>“What has a bold hero to do with these riches, with this treasure of much uncounted
gold?”
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>He began to consider: and then he took enough of this treasure in this plain, this
open plain, to build an abbey for prayers to God. He built a church, a minster church,
ordered the singing of psalms and the ringing of bells, and then Ilyá said:
</p>
<p>“Let him whose treasure it was go and look for it!”
</p>
<p>And then the bold hero turned back again; again he rode to that Burning Stone; again
he wrote beneath that inscription:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“Though I rode by that path, I became not rich.”</p>
</blockquote><p>

<h2 class="main"><span class="corr" id="xd31e1003" title="Source: ILYA">ILYÁ</span> OF MÚROM AND KING KÁLIN.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the palace of the gracious Prince Vladímir, in royal Kiev town, a great feast of
honour was spread for many princes and nobles and for the strong and mighty heroes
and their bold followers, men of the plains, and for the stranger merchants and traders.
</p>
<p>The Fair Sun, Prince Vladímir himself, took his pleasure there, and gave rich gifts
to his guests. To some he gave towns, and to others he gave small towns, to some he
gave villages, and to others he gave hamlets, and to Ilyá of Múrom he gave a coat
of marten fur with a collar of sable.
</p>
<p>But Ilyá received not the fur coat as an honour; he received it without respect and
praised it not. He took the fur coat into the kitchen and dragged the fur coat about
the kitchen floor. Yes, and thus he talked to the fur coat:
</p>
<p>“Just as I drag about this fur coat, so will I drag about that serpent, King Kálin,
by his yellow curls. And just as I pour strong drink upon this fur coat, his heart
shall pour forth his hot blood.”
</p>
<p>And there was a dark-haired maid there, and she reported the matter to Fair Sun, Prince
Vladímir, and said:
<span class="pageNum" id="pb51">[<a href="#pb51">51</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>
<div class="figure p051width" id="p051"><img src="images/p051.png" alt="ДА СОБРАНЪ-ТО БЫЛЪ ПОЧЄСТНОИ ПИРЪ.DA SOBRAN″-TO BYL POCHESTNOI PIR." width="472" height="720"><p class="figureHead"><span class="trans" title="DA SOBRAN″-TO BYL POCHESTNOI PIR."><span lang="ru" class="cyrl">ДА СОБРАНЪ-ТО БЫЛЪ ПОЧЄСТНОИ ПИРЪ.</span></span></p>
</div><p>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb53">[<a href="#pb53">53</a>]</span></p>
<p>“O Fair Sun, Prince Vladímir! When Ilyá of Múrom was in my kitchen, he dragged about
the coat of marten fur; yes, and he said to the fur coat:
</p>
<p>“Just as I drag this fur coat about, so will I drag Prince Vladímir about by his yellow
curly hair, and, just as I pour strong drink upon the fur coat—yes, he himself said
it to the fur coat—the Fair Sun, Prince Vladímir’s hot blood shall be poured out by
my white hands.”
</p>
<p>And the Fair Sun, Prince Vladímir, grew angry, and he cried out in a loud voice:
</p>
<p>“Come, my strong and mighty heroes, take Ilyá away to the dungeon, and put an iron
grating there and cover it over with logs of oak; yes, and bury him with yellow sand.”
</p>
<p>And the heroes came to Ilyá and said:
</p>
<p>“Now, old Cossack, Ilyá of Múrom! Fair Sun Vladímir, the Prince, has ordered us to
put thee in a deep dungeon, and to put an iron grating there, and to cover it all
over with oak logs, yes, and to bury thee with yellow sand.”
</p>
<p>And Ilyá spoke to them and said:
</p>
<p>“Now, what will ye do with me?”
</p>
<p>And the heroes said:
</p>
<p>“There is no sun in the heavens. Not one hero in Holy Russia. Old Cossack, Ilyá of
Múrom! O that we might take thee out of this bitter captivity! Fair Sun, Prince Vladímir,
makes us turn pale.”
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>Then Ilyá mounted his good horse and rode to <span class="pageNum" id="pb54">[<a href="#pb54">54</a>]</span>Kiev town. He rode not into Kiev town, but he rode to the deep dungeon.
</p>
<p>He got down from his good horse, took off the Circassian saddle, took off the braided
bridle and let his brown horse go where God willed.
</p>
<p>Then Ilyá was let down into the deep dungeon, and they put a grating over; they put
it above him and placed oak logs all over it, and buried him with yellow sand.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>Now the glorious Prince Vladímir had an only daughter, and she saw that this was no
small matter that Prince Vladímir of royal Kiev town had put the old Cossack, Ilyá
of Múrom, into that cold dungeon. For it might be that he alone would be able to defend
the Faith and Country; that he alone might defend Kiev town; that he alone might defend
the Minster Church, might protect Vladímir the Prince and the Princess Apráxia.
</p>
<p>So the Princess caused a deep trench to be dug to reach the dungeon of the old Cossack,
Ilyá of Múrom. And she commanded that false keys should be made; and she sent people
secretly to take to the cold dungeon pillows of down and feather beds, and ordered
them to take warm coverlets too, and changes of clothing, and to provide delicate
food for the old Cossack, Ilyá of Múrom. But of this had Vladímir the Prince no knowledge.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>Now that dog, the Tartar King Kálin, burned to <span class="pageNum" id="pb55">[<a href="#pb55">55</a>]</span>be at Kiev town. Even royal Kiev town would he destroy, and all the peasants he would
cut to pieces, and would burn down the churches of God, and also cut off the heads
of Vladímir the Prince and the Princess Apráxia.
</p>
<p>And King Kálin, the dog, sent an envoy to royal Kiev town and gave him a letter to
deliver, and he said to the envoy:
</p>
<p>“When thou goest to royal Kiev town thou wilt be an ambassador in Kiev town to the
glorious Prince Vladímir. Therefore go to the broad courtyard of the Prince’s palace,
and dismount not, but ride in on thy good steed. After thou hast ridden through the
courtyard, then get down off thy steed and go to the palace of white stone, and into
the great hall of white stone and into the dining hall. Go not humbly, but walk in
with a flourish through the five doors and take not thy cap from thy head; but go
up to the oaken table and stand opposite Prince Vladímir and place the letter upon
the golden table before him, and speak to Prince Vladímir and say:
</p>
<p>“O Prince Vladímir of royal Kiev town! Take this letter which is sent to thee, and
look at what is written in the letter and see what is impressed upon it. Clean all
thy arrow-straight streets and the Courts of the Prince in all the town of Kiev, and
in all the broad streets and alleys of the princedom place sweet strong drinks, cask
by cask standing close together, for those who stand by the dog, King Kálin, with
his mighty warriors, in thy town of Kiev.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb56">[<a href="#pb56">56</a>]</span></p>
<p>Prince Vladímir of royal Kiev took the letter sent to him, broke the seal and looked
at what was written therein, and he saw what was in the letter: that he was commanded
to clean the arrow-straight streets and the great Courts of the Prince, and to place
sweet strong drinks in all the broad streets and all the alleys of the princedom.
</p>
<p>Then Vladímir, the Prince of royal Kiev, saw that this was no small matter, but a
great one, and he sat down in his writing-chair and a humble letter wrote he.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“Thou dog, King Kálin! Give me the space of three years, give me three years and three
months, three months and also three days, that I may clean the arrow-straight streets
and the great Courts of the Prince, and make sweet strong drinks and place them in
the town of Kiev and in all the broad streets and in in all the alleys of the glorious
princedom.”</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>The Prince sent off this humble letter to that dog, King Kálin. And the dog, King
Kálin gave him the space of three years, three years and three months, three months
and three days. And day after day the rain it rained, and week after week it ran like
a river, and the time went by—the three years and three months and three days; and
then came the dog, King Kálin. Came beneath the town of Kiev with his great army.
</p>
<p></p>
<div class="figure p057width" id="p057"><img src="images/p057.png" alt="ДА ТАМЪ СТАРЫИ КАЗАКЪ ДА ИЛЬѦ МУРОМЄЦЪ.DA TAM STARYI KAZAK DA IL′IA MUROMET͡S." width="519" height="720"><p class="figureHead"><span class="trans" title="DA TAM STARYI KAZAK DA IL′IA MUROMET͡S."><span lang="ru" class="cyrl">ДА ТАМЪ СТАРЫИ КАЗАКЪ ДА ИЛЬѦ МУРОМЄЦЪ.</span></span></p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>Then Prince Vladímir of royal Kiev began to walk up and down, and tears of grief flowed
from his bright <span class="pageNum" id="pb59">[<a href="#pb59">59</a>]</span>eyes. With a kerchief of silk the Prince wiped his eyes, and he spoke these words:
</p>
<p>“The old Cossack, Ilyá of Múrom, lives no longer, none is there to defend the Faith
and Country; none to defend the Church of God and Kiev town; none to protect Vladímir
the Prince and the Princess <span class="corr" id="xd31e1087" title="Source: Apraxia">Apráxia</span>!”
</p>
<p>Then came to him his dear daughter, and spoke to him these words:
</p>
<p>“O my dear father, Prince Vladímir of royal Kiev, the old Cossack, Ilyá of Múrom,
is yet alive, he is alive in the cold dungeon.”
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>Then Prince Vladímir quickly brought the golden keys and went to the cold dungeon,
and soon unlocked the doors and opened the iron grating. And there was the old Cossack,
Ilyá of Múrom, sitting there in the dungeon, reading the Holy Gospels.
</p>
<p>And there were down pillows and feather beds, and warm coverlets had been brought
there, and changes of apparel and delicate food provided.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>And the Prince took Ilyá by his white hands and by his golden ring, and led him from
the cold dungeon, brought him to his white stone palace, and placed him near himself.
He kissed Ilyá and welcomed him, and invited him to the oaken table, and gave him
sugar sweetmeats to eat and drink made from honey. Then spoke the Prince to Ilyá these
words:
</p>
<p>“Old Cossack, Ilyá of Múrom! Taken is our town of Kiev. The dog, King Kálin, has surrounded
Kiev <span class="pageNum" id="pb60">[<a href="#pb60">60</a>]</span>town with his great army. Do thou defend our Faith and Country and glorious Kiev town,
and defend the Church of the Mother of God, and Vladímir thy Prince and the Princess
Apráxia.”
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>Then the old Cossack, Ilyá of Múrom, went out from the palace of white stone, and
walked through the town of Kiev to his dwelling of white stone. He asked for his beloved
steed, and went to the broad yard and into the stable, and looked at his good war
horse. And Ilyá said:
</p>
<p>“My beloved steed! My trusty and unchanging servant! Well hast thou been looked to,
my hero horse.”
</p>
<p>He kissed him on his sweet mouth, led the good horse from the stable stall and into
the fine broad courtyard; and then the old Cossack began to saddle his good horse
there. Upon the horse he put a saddle-cloth, and upon the saddle-cloth he laid a cloth
of felt; now the saddle-cloth was of silk, and upon the saddle-cloth he laid another
cloth, and then the Circassian saddle. But the Circassian saddle did not hold firmly,
and Ilyá fastened it by twelve girths of silk, and he drew them up with steel pins.
And he fixed on stirrups of steel and buckles of red gold—not for show, but for heroic
strength. Drawn up are the girths of silk, and they break not; steel and iron bend,
but break not; and the buckles of red gold may get wet, but they rust not.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>Ilyá then got upon his good steed, and took with <span class="pageNum" id="pb61">[<a href="#pb61">61</a>]</span>him his hero’s weapons. His club of steel took he, and his grooved spear, his sharp
sabre also, and his whip for the journey. And Ilyá set out from the town of Kiev and
rode through the open plain, and up to the Tartar army. And when he came near and
saw that great host, and heard the shouting of the men and the neighing of the horses,
he began to lose heart. And when the old Cossack, Ilyá of Múrom rode through the free
and open plain, he could not find out where the army ended. He leapt up a high hill,
looked round on all sides and looked down upon the Tartar army; he could see no end
or limit to it.
</p>
<p>He came down from that high hill and rode on through the free and open plain, and
he leapt up another high hill and looked towards the western side and saw some white
tents standing, and by the tents stood heroes’ horses. He hastened down from that
high hill and rode through the freedom of the open plain, and he came to the white
tents. And when Ilyá got down from his good horse near the white tents, there stood
the heroes’ horses. They were standing by a white linen cloth, and on the cloth millet
and spring corn were scattered.
</p>
<p>Ilyá let the silken bridle hang loose on the neck of his good hero horse and urged
on his horse to the white linen, saying:
</p>
<p>“Pleasant indeed would it be to taste it, if the heroes’ horses will allow him upon
the white linen cloth to share the millet and spring corn.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb62">[<a href="#pb62">62</a>]</span></p>
<p>His good horse stood by the linen cloth and began to eat the millet and spring corn,
and the old Cossack, Ilyá of Múrom went to the white tent. In the tent were twelve
heroes, and the heroes were all Russian, and they sat there eating bread and salt,
and they were about to dine.
</p>
<p>And Ilyá went into the tent and said:
</p>
<p>“A good appetite to you, Heroes of Holy Russia, and to thee, Samson, my dear godfather!”
</p>
<p>“Come here, my dear godson!” said his godfather. “Come, old Cossack, Ilyá of Múrom.
Sit down and eat with us.”
</p>
<p>And he stood up on his nimble feet to greet Ilyá of Múrom. And they greeted each other
and kissed each other, and he made Ilyá sit at their table to eat bread and salt with
them. Twelve heroes were they, and Ilyá was the thirteenth. They all ate and drank,
and when they had dined they came away from the oaken table and made their prayer
to God.
</p>
<p>Then the old Cossack, Ilyá of Múrom, spoke and said:
</p>
<p>“My dear godfather, Samson, and you, O mighty Russian heroes! I pray you saddle your
good horses and ride out through the free and open plain to glorious, royal Kiev town.
For before our town of Kiev stands that dog, King Kálin with his great army. He will
lay waste royal Kiev town and cut the peasants to pieces. He will send the churches
of God up in smoke; and as for Prince Vladímir and Apráxia the Princess, he would
cut off their turbulent heads. Now, <span class="pageNum" id="pb63">[<a href="#pb63">63</a>]</span>come ye and defend the Faith and country, and defend our glorious, royal Kiev town,
and protect Prince Vladímir and Apráxia the Princess.”
</p>
<p>And Samson, his godfather, answered him:
</p>
<p>“O my beloved godson, old Cossack, Ilyá of Múrom! We will not saddle our horses and
ride through the free and open plain to defend our Faith and country, and defend royal
Kiev town. We will not defend the churches of God or protect Prince Vladímir and Apráxia
the Princess. For the Prince in truth has many princes and nobles, and he gives them
food and drink and rewards them. Nothing have we from Prince Vladímir.”
</p>
<p>“O Samson, my dear god-father,” said the old Cossack, Ilyá of Múrom, “this would be
no good thing on our part, to stand apart when King Kálin lays waste Kiev town, and
cuts the peasants to pieces, and sends the churches of God up in smoke, and cuts off
the turbulent heads of Vladímir the Prince and the Princess Apráxia. Come, saddle
your good horses and ride through the open plain to Kiev town, to defend the Faith
and country and glorious, royal Kiev, and to protect the churches of God, and Vladímir
the Prince with the Princess Apráxia.”
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>But unavailing were Ilyá’s entreaties; not one hero would join him for the defence
of Kiev town against the Tartar King and his hosts. Nothing had they from Prince Vladímir,
so they would not help him.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb64">[<a href="#pb64">64</a>]</span></p>
<p>When Ilyá saw that he could not persuade them, he went out from the white tent to
his good hero-horse, took him by his silken bridle and led him away from the white
linen cloth, and from the millet and spring corn. And Ilyá got upon his good steed
and rode through the free and open plain, and up to the great Tartar army.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>No bright falcon is this attacking geese and swans and nights of grey ducks, but a
Hero of Holy Russia, advancing to attack that great host of Tartars.
</p>
<p>He urged on his heroic steed, and rode on through the Tartar army. He began to ride
over the Tartar soldiers and to trample them under his horse’s feet, to tread them
under foot and slay them with his spear. He fought with that great army, and beat
down men as if he were mowing grass.
</p>
<p>His good heroic horse spoke to him in human tongue:
</p>
<p>“Come, thou glorious hero of Holy Russia! If thou dost trample down the Tartars, thou
canst not by thyself conquer this great army. Ride thou up to that dog, King Kálin,
and to that great host of soldiers. With him are mighty heroes and bold warrior-women
of the plains. That dog, King Kálin has had three deep trenches made in the glorious
open plain. When thou ridest on the free and open plain, thou wilt beat down many
men of the forces, and when we come to the deep trenches I shall leap out of the first
trench and will bear thee thence. When we come to the next <span class="pageNum" id="pb65">[<a href="#pb65">65</a>]</span>trench, I shall leap out and bear thee thence. But at the third deep trench I shall
leap out, but I shall not bear thee out of it; in the deep trench wilt thou remain.”
</p>
<p>Now the old Cossack, Ilyá of Múrom, liked not this thing. In his white hand he took
his whip with the lash of silk, and beat his horse upon the ribs, and thus he spoke
to his steed:
</p>
<p>“O thou faithless dog! I feed and water thee and provide for thee, and thou wouldst
leave me in the open plain, even in those deep trenches!”
</p>
<p>And Ilyá rode on through the free and open plain to that great army. And he trampled
men under foot and speared them with his spear, and beat them down like mowing grass.
</p>
<p>And Ilyá’s strength grew no less, and when he came to the deep trench his good horse
leapt out again and bore Ilyá thence, and he urged on his hero-horse through the free
and open plain to that great army; and again he trampled the Tartars under foot, and
speared them and beat them down like mowing grass. And Ilyá’s strength grew no less;
he sat his good horse and grew no older. And he cut his way through with his hero-horse
and fell into the second trench. His good steed leapt out and bore Ilyá thence; and
Ilyá again urged on his steed through the free and open plain, and again he trampled
men under foot and speared them, and beat down Tartars like mowing grass. And Ilyá’s
strength became no less; he sat his good steed and grew no older; but he fell into
the <span class="pageNum" id="pb66">[<a href="#pb66">66</a>]</span>third trench. He cut his way through the deep trench, and also out of the third trench
leapt his good heroic steed, but Ilyá he bore not out thence, for Ilyá slipped off
his good horse, and in the deep trench he remained.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>And there came the Tartars running to catch the good horse, but the heroic steed would
not allow himself to be taken, but galloped away through the open plain.
</p>
<p>Then came the pagan Tartars and fell upon the old Cossack, Ilyá of Múrom, and they
chained together his nimble feet, and bound his white hands, and the Tartars said:
</p>
<p>“Cut off his turbulent head.”
</p>
<p>But some of the Tartars said:
</p>
<p>“There is no need to cut off his turbulent head; we will lead Ilyá to the dog, King
Kálin, and what he commands that must we do.”
</p>
<p>And they took Ilyá through the open plain to that pavilion of white linen, and led
him in to the dog, King Kálin, and placed him before the King, and spoke thus to King
Kálin:
</p>
<p>“Now, O King Kálin, we have taken the old Cossack, Ilyá of Múrom, and have brought
him to thee, O King. Do to him as thou wilt.”
</p>
<p>Then the dog, King Kálin spoke to Ilyá, and said:
</p>
<p>“Now, thou old Cossack, Ilyá of Múrom! A young puppy have they let loose against my
great army! How couldst thou alone overcome my great host? Unchain Ilyá’s nimble feet
and unloose his white hands.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb67">[<a href="#pb67">67</a>]</span></p>
<p>So the Tartars removed the bonds from his feet and hands, and the dog, King Kálin
said:
</p>
<p>“Now old Cossack, Ilyá of Múrom! Sit down with me at my table, and eat of my sugar
sweetmeats and drink of my honey drink. Wear my costly garments, and take from my
chest of gold what thou needest. Serve no longer the Prince Vladímir, but serve the
dog, King Kálin.”
</p>
<p>And Ilyá answered the King:
</p>
<p>“I will not sit at the same table with thee, nor eat thy sugar sweetmeats, nor drink
of thy honey drinks. I will not wear thy costly garments, nor take gold from thy chest.
I will not serve thee, thou dog, King Kálin, but will serve my Faith and country,
and defend the churches of God and Vladímir the Prince and the Princess Apráxia.”
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>Then went forth the old Cossack, Ilyá of Múrom, from that tent of white linen, into
the free and open plain. And the pagan Tartars began to press upon him and tried to
surround him, hoping to gain possession of the old Cossack’s gear. Ilyá saw that he
must bestir himself, and he seized a Tartar by his feet and began to swing him round,
began to strike the Tartars with the Tartar, till they began to flee from him. And
the old Cossack went thus through the whole Tartar army, and came forth into the free
and open plain, and cast the Tartar on one side.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>Then Ilyá walked on through the open plain, and <span class="pageNum" id="pb68">[<a href="#pb68">68</a>]</span>he had neither horse nor weapons, but he whistled a mighty whistle, and his good steed
heard him on the open plain, and galloped to the old Cossack his master. The old Cossack,
Ilyá got upon his good steed and rode on through the plain till he came to a high
hill, and he leapt up the hill and looked down towards the west. And in the west near
the white tents stood the good horses of the heroes. Ilyá turned that way with his
good war-horse. He took his strong bow and bent it with his white hands. He tightened
the bowstring of silk, placed the sharp arrow, and into the white tent shot he that
arrow, saying:
</p>
<p>“Fly, O sharp arrow, fly to the white tent. Take the roof off the white tent, and
go, thou arrow, to the white breast of my godfather. Creep thou into his breast and
make a scratch, only a small scratch, a small scratch, not a large one. He sleeps
there and takes his ease, and little can I do here alone.”
</p>
<p>And he let go the silken bowstring and sent off that sharp arrow, and that sharp arrow
whistled into that hero’s white tent. It took the roof off the white tent and fell
upon the white breast of Samson. It crept into his white breast and made but a small
prick, and Samson, the renowned hero of Holy Russia, woke up from his deep sleep and
opened his bright eyes. Quickly he stood upon his nimble feet and cried:
</p>
<p>“Ho! my renowned heroes of Holy Russia! Quickly saddle your good horses and mount
them. From my beloved godson has flown a sharp arrow through my glorious white tent.
From my tent it took the roof, <span class="pageNum" id="pb69">[<a href="#pb69">69</a>]</span>and the arrow crept into my white breast, made a small prick, not a large one. The
cross at my neck preserved me, Samson, the cross at my neck weighing forty stone.
Had that cross not been upon my breast, my tempestuous head would have been torn off.”
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>Then all those heroes of Holy Russia quickly saddled their good horses and rode through
the open plain, towards Kiev town, to the Tartar army.
</p>
<p>And from the high hill the old Cossack, Ilyá of Múrom, saw them, as they rode their
good horses. He came down from the high hill and rode to meet the Russian heroes.
Twelve in number were the heroes and Ilyá was the thirteenth.
</p>
<p>They rode up to the Tartar host and pushed on their heroic steeds and began to fight
the Tartar army. And they were trampling on the great army, and they came to the linen
tent.
</p>
<p>And in the tent that dog, King Kálin was sitting, and the heroes said:
</p>
<p>“We will cut off the turbulent head of that dog, King Kálin.”
</p>
<p>“Why should we cut off his turbulent head?” said the old Cossack, Ilyá of Múrom. “We
will take him to royal Kiev town, to the glorious Prince Vladímir.”
</p>
<p>So to the glorious Prince Vladímir at the royal town of Kiev they took the dog, King
Kálin. To the white stone palace they took him, and Vladímir, Prince of royal Kiev,
took that dog by his white hands and <span class="pageNum" id="pb70">[<a href="#pb70">70</a>]</span>made him sit at the oaken table, gave him sugar sweetmeats to eat and honey drink
to drink.
</p>
<p>And to Vladímir the Prince spoke King Kálin these words:
</p>
<p>“Come now, Vladímir, Prince of royal Kiev, do not cut off my warlike head. We will
write between us a great writing, and I, King Kálin, will pay thee tribute for ever
and ever—I to thee, Prince Vladímir!”
</p>
<p>And then in those good old times they all sang Glory!
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>And so they had peace for a time, but fresh hordes of Tartars still came, and the
Russian heroes fought them, and sometimes the Russians could not overcome the Tartars,
and in one of these great fights Ilyá, they say, was caught away from the fighting,
and he was turned into stone, and his good horse with him.

royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
